            	<h3><b>GRANTS</b></h3>
				<p>Grants are funds that normally do not require repayment. Due to limited funds, most state grant funds are no longer available to students who complete financial aid applications after the published deadlines. It is important to submit all requested documents to the Office of Financial Aid by the published priority deadline to be considered for grant funds.</p>

				<p>Undergraduate students must enroll full-time to receive maximum grant funding. If you enroll less than full-time, most grants (including the Federal Pell Grant) will prorate based on your enrollment. </p>
				<p>The chart below details enrollment definitions at UTA.</p>

		<h3><b>HONORS</b></h3>
		
		<p>
		<b>A Community of Over-Achievers:</b>
		The Honors College of The University of Texas at Arlington is a diverse community of student scholars from all majors who are dedicated to academics, creative activity, research, and service. Through our sponsorship of co-curricular lectures and symposia, we cultivate intellectual curiosity and serve as a resource for the wider University community. In addition, outreach programs sponsored by the Honors College serve high-achieving high school students and teachers in the region.
		The Honors College is committed to the development of citizen-scholars. Honors students are encouraged to participate in community service and to seek leadership opportunities at UTA. Moreover, we take seriously our obligation to enlarge students' understanding of the world. To that end, we offer highly respected study abroad programs that provide students with opportunities to engage with the people, events, movements, ideas, and products of cultures other than their own; to link historical events and developments with those of the 21st century; and to understand the contributions of other peoples and regions to American culture and institutions.</p>
